## Purpose

This application is used to show a list of film recommendations from friends, to sort those recs, and to rate them once I've watched them. The backbone of this application was built using the methods outlined in the article linked above (saved in the medium_article branch).

Also, this is using jqueri-ui and ajax to make the recommendations sortable and update that order without having to refresh the page.

Using a pipeline from GitHub -> CodeShip -> Heroku for the deployments and that's mentioned in [this article](https://medium.com/@oh_boyd/from-a-new-app-to-deployment-using-postgres-rspec-github-heroku-and-codeship-aa80a020da10).
